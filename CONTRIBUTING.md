## Git Branching Strategy

We incorporate a modified [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow) branching strategy. 

Each feature has an overarching branch that is prefixed with `<issue number>-feature-<feature_name>` which then has subsequent branches implementing parts of that feature. The intention is to make small PRs that are easier to [conduct code review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4b3OSwuLM8) for. See the attached image example for more details.
