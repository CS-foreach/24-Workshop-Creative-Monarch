## Resources
- [YouTube/Yung-Jake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkvmUNqg69U)
- [Padlet](https://padlet.com/rlay4/24-monarch-creative-coding-archive-r22jsj97ee6tgmmc)
- [Sketch Template](https://editor.p5js.org/totally-not-frito-lays/sketches/lAKwSMFUh)

## Notes

- Start by sharing the Yung-Jake video
- Get students to open up the template
- start activity

Activity
- Have them design the shape that's used as the brush
- Have them add in new features to the template
- Have them just make art using the default
- Make sure they can save the screenshot really easily

- size
- opacity
- color

## After action report
- Attendance: ~13-14 students
- About half the students just used the starter template to make art and only changed the emoji that they used
  - The other half experimented with changes to the template
    - Most of this half changed the background color
    - One person changed the shape from a circle to an arc
- Ran into some weird behavior when having them save, failed to save
  - We should have them duplicate the template before interacting with it at all
- Students overall seemed to enjoy the creative freedom that they had and the agency they had. 
- Some students didn't seem to care too much for the drawing part.
- Frustrations were due in large part to the canvas resetting each time they made changes to the code (should warn them ahead of time)
- Most students still aren't saving the template to their account.
