## After action report
- Attendance: ~13-14 students
- About half the students just used the starter template to make art and only changed the emoji that they used
  - The other half experimented with changes to the template
    - Most of this half changed the background color
    - One person changed the shape from a circle to an arc
- Ran into some weird behavior when having them save, failed to save
  - We should have them duplicate the template before interacting with it at all
