# Week 6 - Emoji Emotions
## Learning Goals
- Getting familiar with the `draw()` loop and draw background
- Adding interactivity using `mouseX`
- Using `constrain()` to limit movement to a set of bounds

## Tasks
- [ ] Students tweak the emoji to add interactivity

## Resources
- [Padlet](https://padlet.com/rlay4/24-monarch-creative-coding-archive-r22jsj97ee6tgmmc)
- [Sketch Template](https://editor.p5js.org/totally-not-frito-lays/sketches/hbw-hJvn2)

## Notes

- Start by doing a code tour 
    - introduce `draw()`
    - define difference between `setup()` and `draw()`
    - demonstrate `let mouthHeight = constrain(mouseY, 0, 125);`

Activity
- Have them add interactivity to their emoji

Feature ideas
- Eye tracking
- Eye brows
- Add food to the mouse

Template features
- Mouth opens larger depending on where the mouse is

## After action report
- Attendance: ~13-14 students
- In hindsight, it would be better to demonstrate the student agency rather than to explain how the starter code works
- We should probably review the best way to duplicate and save their own copy of the code at the beginning. Can either:
     1) Duplicate the code first, then save code copy. Then they can make edits, save the image, then the code. Upload the image and link to the padlet afterwards. 
     2) Edit code directly once they receive the link, but instruct them to save the image first before saving the code. Then, upload the image and link to the padlet. 
- It would be better to give students a clear understanding of what they should design their project towards
     1) That way, they can learn to use the new tools we are teaching them rather than having it too open-ended
- Some students got a good grasp of using `mouseX` and `mouseY`, one was able to offset it by adding/subtracting values from it
- Be sure to keep everyone's attention next time (a number of them were on phones)
