# Week 6 - Emoji Emotions
## Learning Goals
- Getting familiar with the `draw()` loop and draw background
- Adding interactivity using `mouseX`
- Using `constrain()` to limit movement to a set of bounds

## Tasks
- [ ] Students tweak the emoji to add interactivity

## Resources
- [Padlet](https://padlet.com/rlay4/24-monarch-creative-coding-archive-r22jsj97ee6tgmmc)
- [Sketch Template](https://editor.p5js.org/totally-not-frito-lays/sketches/hbw-hJvn2)

## Notes

- Start by doing a code tour 
    - introduce `draw()`
    - define difference between `setup()` and `draw()`
    - demonstrate `let mouthHeight = constrain(mouseY, 0, 125);`

Activity
- Have them add interactivity to their emoji

Feature ideas
- Eye tracking
- Eye brows
- Add food to the mouse

Template features
- Mouth opens larger depending on where the mouse is

## After action report
- Attendance: ~13-14 students
- In hindsight, it would be better to demonstrate the student agency rather than to explain how the starter code works
- We should probably review the best way to duplicate and save their own copy of the code at the beginning
- It would be better give students a clear understanding of what they should design their project towards
