# Week 7 - Key Events
## Learning Goals
- the `keyPressed` function
- condition blocks

## Activity
- Personalize [the template](https://editor.p5js.org/phentos/sketches/FrvyS3wAZ) (4-way movement of a circle using keyboard arrow keys)
  - the above sketch uses `e.key`, consider swapping to `keyCode`
 
- Ideas to start:
  - Add a key to change...
    - the size of the circle
    - the color of the circle
    - what gets drawn (circle -> emoji perhaps)
  - Add a second object with its own keys

## After action report
