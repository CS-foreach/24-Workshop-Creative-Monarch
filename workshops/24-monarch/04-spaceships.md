# Week 4 - Spaceships
## Learning Goals
- Variables used for relative and absolute positioning

## Tasks
- [ ] Students create a spaceship and clone it

## Resources
- [Padlet](https://padlet.com/rlay4/24-monarch-creative-coding-archive-r22jsj97ee6tgmmc)
- [Sketch Template](https://editor.p5js.org/totally-not-frito-lays/sketches/24JHmA7cy)

## Notes

- Using variables to make relative vs absolute positioning possible
- Demonstrate use of triangle as three separate points

```
// All of these examples draw the same triangle with varying
// levels of variable usage
triangle(100, 100, 70, 130, 130, 130);
triangle(100, 100, 100 - 30, 100 + 30, 100 + 30, 100 + 30);
triangle(x, x, x - 30, x + 30, x + 30, x + 30);
triangle(x, y, x - 30, y + 30, x + 30, y + 30);
```

## After action report
- Attendance: ~15
    - All returning students + 3 new students
- Still hardcoding values instead of using relative ones
    - some students use relative values but didn't know how to make their space ships personalized
- Students still having a hard time sharing their projects to the padlet
    - simplify this process by just having them post the link, title it later
    - it'd be awesome to have a custom built padlet that automatically took a screen cap of the running code and uploaded that instead
- Should have had an intermediary lesson to have students learn how to draw more complex shapes from simple ones (extend off of previous emoji workshop)
    - less learning but more practice with using numbers to draw shapes
