# Workshop 2 - Intro

## Brainstorming

- Simulate Particle, (hide) the majority of the physics sim and allow them to tune parameters to alter physics

Things to tweak

- Speed
- Size
- Number of particles
- Threshold for line distance
- Writing a mixture of colors (change the ratio of colors)

## Learning Goals

- Introduce P5
- Variables and Arguments are values
- Functions are collections of instructions

## Resources

Class Links

- [Padlet](https://padlet.com/rlay4/24-monarch-creative-coding-week-2-688tu3ts6x9gm3n7)

P5 Reference Links

- [Particles](https://editor.p5js.org/nlchung/sketches/GOIwrMlgO)

## Setup

- Tables in a semi-circle arrangement
- Screen will showcase some super fancy example that builds off of mostly the mechanics we learn in this lesson

## Agenda

We'll be employing the Use-Modify-Create framework.

1. Review agenda
2. Set ground rules for using the computers (only use p5 pls)
3. Introduce P5.js and what it does and is capable of
4. Show how to make an account, share, run code
    1. Have students look through examples to find one that they like and share it to the padlet
5. Live Coding Exercise 
    1. Showcase how to tune paramters
    2. Parameter tuning in particles
