# Week 9 - Design - **3 WEEKS LEFT!**
## Learning Goals
- Learn about video game level design
- Design a platforming level
- Identify gameplay bugs

## Resources
- Template: [`Platformer`](https://editor.p5js.org/nlchung/sketches/QiAvKoa-2)
- Padlet: [`Week 9`](https://padlet.com/nlchung/24-monarch-creative-coding-week-9-zcmq76rmgwj7odbm)

## Schedule
- 5 minutes: what goes into a platforming game?
- 2 minutes: physics in 2 minutes
- 3 minutes: Demo the demo
- 30 minutes: Create!
- 10 minutes: Share!

## After Action Report
- Attendance: 11-12 students
- Students struggled to find/modify the level creation code
  Causes:
  - chonky template
  - incorrect assumptions made about helper functions
  - lack of knowledge on what code changes correspond with different results
    - likely not enough programming experience to experiment
  - missed Korey's initial explanation and didn't want to raise their hands
  Fix:
  - Isolate level design code
  - More deliberate level design step explanation
  - Slides that cover our explanations w/ visuals, so they can refer back to it
