# 24-Workshop-Creative_Coding-Monarch

Learning to code for the sake of coding is boring. Let's try teaching code
as a means to make cool stuff! In this case, we're using code to make art using P5.js.

## Learning Goals:

Learning goals set the end goal of the workshop of lesson plan. What are the key
takeaways? This helps curriculum developers determine what is supplemental and 
what is important.

- Make sure the students have fun
- Make sure the students have something they can show to friends / family
- It should be something genuinely different from what they can make without code
