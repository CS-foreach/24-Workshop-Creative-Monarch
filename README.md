# 24-Workshop-Creative_Coding-Monarch

Learning to code for the sake of coding is boring. Let's try teaching code
as a means to make cool stuff! In this case, we're using code to make art using P5.js.

## Learning Goals

Learning goals set the end goal of the workshop of lesson plan. What are the key
takeaways? This helps curriculum developers determine what is supplemental and 
what is important.

- Make sure the students have fun
- Make sure the students have something they can show to friends / family
- It should be something genuinely different from what they can make without code

The [wiki](https://github.com/CS-foreach/Creative-Coding-P5/wiki) will contain most of the "how to use" information as well as logs for decisions and workshop plans. This repo is currently under development so the "how to use" is subject to change.
